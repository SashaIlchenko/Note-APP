      Notes App
The Notes App is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, archive, and unarchive notes. Users can add new notes, which will be displayed in the active notes list. They can then choose to archive specific notes, which will move the notes to the archived notes list, making them hidden from the active notes list. However, users can still access and unarchive the archived notes to bring them back to the active notes list.

Archive notes: Users can archive specific notes from the active notes list by clicking the "Archive" button associated with each note. Archived notes will be moved to the archived notes list.

View archived notes: Users can click the "View Archived Notes" on the header of table button to see the list of archived notes. Archived notes will be displayed in the "Archived Notes" section with a "Restore" button next to each note.
